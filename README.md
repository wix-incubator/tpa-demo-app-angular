# Wix app - Angular Demo Widget
### **Overview**

This boilerplate will make it easy for you to [start developing](http://dev.wix.com/) your [Wix app](https://www.wix.com/app-market/main). 
The project is already set up with a widget component and its app settings panel.

Most apps have a server side, but to keep it simple, we'll focus only on the client side.

### **Features**
* Uses the official Wix UI-lib and [UI controls](https://dev.wix.com/docs/ui-lib/ui-controls/)
* Demo implementation of the appâ€™s interaction with its settings panel 
* Option to use plain CSS (we use SASS by default)
* Updated with the latest version of [Wix SDK](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/using-the-sdk/)

### **Getting started**
Before you start - get [node.js - version 10.16.0](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Run the app:

1. Clone our starter template
`git clone https://github.com/wix/tpa-demo-app-angular.git`
2. Navigate to your project folder
`cd tpa-demo-app-angular/`
3. Install npm
`npm install`
4. Run webpack
`webpack`
5. Run the app
`npm start`

This will run a webserver on your local host. You can now view your app in your browser: https://localhost:5000/widget.html

### **Registering the app**

1. Create an app at: https://dev.wix.com/dc3/my-apps
2. Go to your "Workspace" and add a new website component of the "Widget" type and give it a name.
  * Component URL should be: https://localhost:5000/widget.html
  * Set the width to 300px and height to 400px.
3. Set the App Settings URL to: 
  * https://localhost:5000/settings.html
4. Save your app.
5. Click "Test your app" in the dashboard, and see that it functions.
6. Set your app up on a server to ensure everything works in a production enviorment.
