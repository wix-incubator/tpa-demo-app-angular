# Wix app - Angular Demo Widget
### **Overview**

This boilerplate will make it easy for you to [start developing](http://dev.wix.com/) your [Wix app](https://www.wix.com/app-market/main). 
The project is already set up with a widget component and its App settings panel.

Most apps have a server side, but to keep it simple, we'll focus only on the client side.

### **Features**
* Uses the official Wix UI-lib and [UI controls](http://dev.wix.com/docs/ui-lib/ui-controls/)
* Demo implementation of the appâ€™s interaction with its settings panel 
* Option to use plain CSS (we use SASS by default)
* Updated with the latest version of [Wix SDK](http://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/using-the-sdk/)

### **Getting started**
Before you start - get [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

Generate the app:

1. Clone our starter template
`git clone git@github.com:wix/tpa-demo-app-angular.git`
2. Navigate to your project folder
`cd tpa-demo-app-angular/`
3. Install npm
`npm install`
4. Run webpack
`webpack`
5. Run the app
`npm start`

This will run a webserver on your local host. You can now view your app in your browser: http://localhost:5000/widget.html

### **Registering the app**

1. Follow the registration guide to create a new app.
2. Add a Widget endpoint:
  * Endpoint URL with the following URL: http://localhost:5000/widget.html
  * Set the width to 300px and height to 400px.
3. Set the App Setting URL to: 
  * http://localhost:5000/settings.html
  * Set the height (up to 578px). 
4. Save your app.
5. In order to test the widget in localhost in the Wix editor you need to disable the editor/site SSL.
* You can toggle HTTPS at the bottom of your [website settings overview](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Manage%20Settings&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/manage-website).
6. Set your app up on a server to ensure everything works.
* Be sure to [toggle back on HTTPS](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Manage%20Settings&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/manage-website) in the editor, and enable HTTPS in webpack by setting `https: true` in the server.js file.
